# Immersive Interfaces and Visualization for iOS
Samples and solutions for a Swift/SpriteKit/SceneKit course I am teaching (Autumn Quarter 2015), through University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education. The course is organized into four units: Swift, SpriteKit, D3.js, and SceneKit.

The full [bibliography](Supporting%20material/CP135%20Bibliography.pdf) is included.

For the Swift unit, we used Daniel Steinberg's excellent book [A Swift Kickstart](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/a-swift-kickstart/id891801923?mt=13). Files for the remaining units:

## SpriteKit
[Playgrounds/Balloons.playground](Playgrounds/Balloons.playground): The original Swift balloon cannon demo, updated for Swift 2.0.

[Playgrounds/Crawl.playground](Playgrounds/Crawl.playground): A text crawl at the bottom of the screen, as you might see on a TV news or sports broadcast.

[Playgrounds/SpriteKit Basics.playground](Playgrounds/Playgrounds/SpriteKit%20Basics.playground): Illustrations of some SpriteKit concepts. Shown are node hierachies; automatic and explicit Z ordering; a sample of each SKNode type; animations and actions; "look at" and "follow" constraints; simple physics; and a sample of each SCNTransition.

[Plummet](Plummet): A gravity indicator, or plumb bob, using CMMotionManager and SpriteKit.

[SpriteKit Particle System Sampler](SpriteKit%20Particle%20System%20Sampler/): A sample of each of the Xcode-supplied particle systems.

[Spiral Illusion](Spiral%20Illusion/) An optical illusion. Targets for both iOS and tvOS.

[Marble Trails](Marble%20Trails/) Demonstration of physics bodies, variable gravity based on CMMotionManager, and gravity fields.

[Collision Detection Bostock](Collision%20Detection%20Bostock) A SpriteKit reimplementation of Mike Bostock's D3.js (force-directed graph demonstration)[http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3231298].

[AVCam-iOSUsingAVFoundationtoCaptureImagesandMovies)](AVCam-iOSUsingAVFoundationtoCaptureImagesandMovies): Apple camera sample, with a transparent SpriteKit as a notional HUD.

[Empty SpriteKit](Empty%20SpriteKit): A blank, square, SKScene/SKView, centered on the device.

## D3.js

[WebView Sampler](WebView%20Sampler): Demonstration of WKWebView, loading various websites, local pages, and D3.js samples.

[JS Conversation](JS%20Conversation): Communication between Swift code and JavaScript/WKWebView. Illustrates converting Swift data to JavaScript and sending to a WKWebView, triggering Swift alerts from JavaScript, sending a JavaScript object to Swift, and conversion back to a native Swift object.

[CIRIMS Viewer](CIRIMS%20Viewer): Visualization of some oceanographic data from UW Applied Physical Laboratory.

## SceneKit
